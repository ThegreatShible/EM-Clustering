# EM-Clustering
This project is an implementation of a clusturing algorithm based on model mixture implemented with R.
It assumes a gaussian distribution on continious variables with a "VVV" covariance matrix configuration, and a multinomial distriubtion on discrete variables with the independence between them.

The model can be trained with different number of clusters, and to take the best model, the BIC and ICL values are given for each result.

See the examples in `./examples`
